Ultimately, an NBA-designated physician would need to concur with the Bucks' assessment that Prince is unlikely to return before June 15 in order for Milwaukee to be granted a DPE, which would enable to the team to sign a player to a one-year deal worth about $1.7 million -- half of Prince's salary -- or less.

The 21-year-old guard got off to a hot start to his rookie season before undergoing surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee in December 2024. The Duke product later underwent thumb surgery in September 2025 and missed time to begin the 2025-26 campaign. Once healthy, he struggled to carve out a consistent role behind Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe. Now, McCain will provide backcourt depth for Oklahoma City, competing for minutes with the likes of Cason Wallace, Ajay Mitchell and Nikola Topic (groin) once he returns. However, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdomen) is set to be re-evaluated after the All-Star break, so McCain could see increased playing time right away."
